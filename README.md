# Researcher introduction
Kia ora! My name is Steven Turnbull and I am a PhD student in Education. I am based in the school of Critical Studies in Education and my supervisors are Dr Kirsten Locke and Dr Dion O’Neale. My thesis will explore how a person’s life experiences impact on their choices to study science in higher education.

# Research Purpose and an Invitation
Broadly speaking, my research looks at why people choose to study science. This question alone is quite important, with governments across the world concerned with the number of students who are dropping out of science subjects at school. I want to take a positive approach to answering this question, by understanding the factors in a person’s life that positively impact on aspirations to study science. I am interested in the perspectives of all students, regardless of whether they study science or not.
My research is based on a sociological theory set out by Pierre Bourdieu, who argued that access to resources affects not only the accessibility of a career path, but also our desires to pursue that path.  An obvious resource is money, while things such as knowing someone in that career, or even watching a particular TV program about that career are also important. My goal is to understand what resources are important for students who ended up wanting to study science.

As a part of my research, I would be very interested in interviewing you. You have been identified because you have signalled that you would be interesting in being interviewed on a survey administered to students at the University of Auckland. If you choose to participate, you will be one of around 30 students who will be interviewed. My aim is to understand your science background, levels of interest in science, and what your plans for the future are. Your participation in this study is totally voluntary – you can refuse to participate and withdraw at any time during the interview. You will be given a $20 voucher as a reward for participating.

# Project Procedures
Phase 1: A short online survey administered to all students studying a Bachelor of Science qualification. The main purpose of the questionnaire is to obtain preliminary information regarding demographic background, science experiences, family and peer views of science.
Phase 2: Follow up interviews will be conducted with 20 participants who completed the survey and gave consent to be interviewed. The interviews will select students on a first to reply basis, with a focus on students who are typically less well represented in science. Interviews will focus on survey responses, but will be semi-structured. This means that I am more interested in having a conversation with participants and understanding what they think is important. This interview will take less than an hour, and will be located in a private space at the University of Auckland (if participants are not happy with the location, they can offer a more suitable location).

I will be looking to ask participants about various topics that were touched on in the previous survey. This may include views on science, and connections with other people in science. I will also ask about the role that family, friends and teachers have played during the participant’s life so far.

The interview will be audio recorded, transcribed, and then analysed. If participants volunteer contact information, I will share the interview transcript with them, firstly to ensure that they are still comfortable with the information shared, and secondly to ensure that I have transcribed everything correctly (participants will have 2 weeks to make any changes). The only cost to participants will be the time given to the survey and interview, and potentially the travel to the interview. Your grades or experiences at the university will not be affected by anything you say (as guaranteed by Professor John Hosking, Dean of Science).

# What are the benefits for you when participating in this research?
Interview participants will be given a $20 grocery voucher. 

# Data storage/retention/destruction/future use 
I will audio record the follow up interviews so that I can transcribe them verbatim (i.e., word-for-word), and analyse it. It is possible that a 3rd party that has signed a confidentiality agreement will be used to transcribe interviews. Participants will be able to volunteer contact information to receive a copy of the interview transcript so that they can review what has been said, and check that it has been transcribed correctly. Participants will have 2 weeks to make any changes. All electronic data will be stored on a password protected computer on a secure University of Auckland server for 6 years. All physical data, including consent forms, will be kept in a locked file cabinet in my supervisor’s office for 6 years. After a 6 year period, any electronic data will be permanently erased, and any physical data will be destroyed and put in a bin at the University of Auckland designated for confidential information. 

# Anonymity and Confidentiality
To protect your confidentiality, survey responses will be fully anonymous (except students who volunteer their contact details to receive a copy of results, or consent to be interviewed). Interview participants will choose a pseudonym at the beginning of the follow up interview. This pseudonym will be used in transcriptions, and in any future reporting or publications. I will not seek to find out other identifiable information (e.g., addresses). We will ensure privacy during the interview by conducting it a secure location on campus at the University of Auckland. The research team will sign a confidentiality agreement, along with any 3rd party transcribers. My supervisor Dr Dion O’Neale is a lecturer in physics and may have taught participants, or may teach participants in the future. To avoid any conflict of interest, Dion has not been involved in the selection of participants and will not be involved with the interview process. For participants who are students of the researchers, we give our assurance that participation or non-participation in this study will have no effect on grades or relationships with the University of Auckland. Participants may contact their Head of Department should you feel that this assurance has not been met.

# Right to Withdraw from Participation
Although I do not expect that the topics we talk about will cause any discomfort, participants may be uncomfortable divulging personal experiences that they have been through. I want to make it explicitly clear that participants do not have to talk about anything they are uncomfortable with. Participants may withdraw from the survey and follow up interview at any time without giving reason, and can withdraw your consent for me to use interview information within a 2 week timeframe after the interview.

If for any reason participants are significantly uncomfortable with the interview, they can be put in contact with the university counselling centre (923 7681; Kate Edger Information Commons, Level 3).

# Contact Details and Approval Wording
If participants do agree to participate in this study, their contact information can be volunteered so that I can contact you. I will only contact participants to share interview transcripts and a summary of the findings. I will never identify the research participants.
Participants can contact me (Steven Turnbull; s.turnbull@auckland.ac.nz), my superviors Dr Kirsten Locke (k.locke@auckland.ac.nz) and Dr Dion O’Neale (d.oneal@auckland.ac.nz) or my head of school Assoc. Prof Carol Mutch (c.mutch@auckland.ac.nz) if they have any concerns about the research. The Head of Department for Physics, Professor Richard Easther, can be contacted at r.easther@auckland.ac.nz.
